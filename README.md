## 📝️ URI Online Judge

[URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) is a platform that provides programming practice through challenges and exercises, with hundreds of problems that can be solved using 20 different languages. Each problem belongs to one of 8 big categories, allowing both the begginner and the expert to find a suitable challenge for his level.

By listing exercises for complete beginners, URI is perfect for instructors who wish to use an auto grading platform.

A complete list of supported languages is shown below.

## 💡️ Motivation

After solving a lot of problems in URI, using more than one programming language, I found myself with a lot of challenges solved, but had no way to show any of them to my students, as only me could see it.

I had one option: look for each one of my passing solutions, copy the code and save on my HDD or....

build an script to download everything.

Why not, right?

We do it because we can
###### ...and because is fun.

## ☑️ TODO

After being able to write a simple script that would gather my passing codes on URI, I decided to make it a little more professional: as a CLI providing filters and options to the codes that should be downloaded.

Some of the things that I want to improve (or already have):

- [x] Asynchronous
- [x] Command Line Interface
- [ ] Filter by:
  - [x] Language (it's done but I can improve it)
  - [x] Answer Code
  - [ ] Question ID
- [ ]  Give option to save in a different path
- [ ]  Make it possible to save the question along with the passing code
- [ ]  Create README section to explain how to use
- [ ]  Refactor the code, is a little mess right now 😅️
